Requirements: 1. 3 Different D3 layouts within a single dashboard
              2. Automatic scaling of all axes in a single layout during data update
              3. Cross-layout brushing in which moussing over one data point in one chart highlights multiple 
                 associated data points in another chart
              4. Bidirectional interaction between three charts
              5. Faceted selection interaction between two layouts (in which mouseover or click in one layout results in 
                 data being filtered in a second layout)
              6. Map layout that has interaction with another layout
              7. Scalar data on a map (e.g. circles of different sizes to indicate different weightage)
              8. Cross-layout brushing in which dragging a rectangle over several data points in one chart 
                 highlights multiple associated data points in another chart
              9. Clustering analysis
